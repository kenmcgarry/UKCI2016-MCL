Description: High-throughput experiments are now widely used in biological researches, which improves both the quality and quantity of omics data. Network-based presentation of these data has become a popular way in data analyses. This package mainly provides functions for biological network construction, visualization and analyses. Networks can be constructed either from experimental data or from a set of proteins and integrated PPI database. Based on them, users can perform traditional visualization, along with the subcellular localization based ones for Homo sapiens and Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, analyses including topological statistics, functional module clustering and go profiling can also be achieved.
